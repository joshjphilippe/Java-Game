This is just a personal project.

The goal is to make a Text based adventure game (TBAG).

The main goal for this TBAG is to create a a TBAG with a GUI attached to it.

I had a version of this as CLI only and there were a lot of checks needed but the GUI helped me delete a lot of those.
And it keeps the game state "looping"

This will get better

Planned immediate features: npcs, combat, items
