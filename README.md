This is just a personal project.

The goal is to make a Text based adventure game (TBAG).

The main goal for this TBAG is to create a a TBAG with an UI attached to it. The UI will help me reduce a lot of internal code, imo, involving checks and usage of objects.

I had a version of this as CLI only and there were a lot of checks needed but the UI helped me delete a lot of those.

This will get better

Planned immediate features: npcs, combat, items
