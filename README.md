This is just a personal project.

The goal is to make a Text based adventure game (TBAG).

The main goal for this TBAG is to create a a TBAG with a GUI attached to it.

I had a version of this as CLI only and there were a lot of checks needed but the GUI helped me delete a lot of those.
And it keeps the game state "looping"

This will get better

Planned immediate features: npcs, combat, items

^^ Well this was a lie

Added: Woodcutting and Tools

Woodcutting isn't done yet, I want to add a respawn timer to trees. Something like once a zone is cleared the player can't return there for woodcutting until x amount of time has passed. Most likely going to need to store this time value somewhere so the player can't close the game and reopen it and "start over".

Planned Features: Better Combat and NPCs, Store, More Skills (Once I'm satisifed with woodcutting), Area/Zone Travelling, Quests.. more to be added
---------------------------------------------

Added runnable jar file!
